### Media queries
Use the media-mixin for media queries. See app/setup/scss/mixins/_media.scss

```scss
@mixin media($up: null, $down: null, $media: all, $breakpoints: $breakpoints) {}
```

Use media-mixin within selectors, not the other way around

```scss
.foo {
  @include media(xxs, $media: screen) {
    display: block;
  }
  
  @include media(sm, md, screen) {
    display: inline;
  }
}
```
